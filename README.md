S3KGM (*Short, Simple, Semantic Knowledge Graphs Model*) is a model for semantic representation of arbitrary complexity texts, specifically sentences. 
This representation is carried out in the same lexical-semantic space of elements defined by a specific set of static embeddings, and is given by a set of embedding vectors (unlike the usual representations by means of a single vector) that correspond to the different facts that can be extracted from the sentence.
Code is complete EXCEPT Word2vec and Glove embedding files. There are links to dowload them in the 'embeddings' folder.
