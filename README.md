S3KGM (*Short, Simple, Semantic Knowledge Graphs Model*) is a model for semantic representation of arbitrary complexity texts, specifically sentences. 
This representation is carried out in the same lexical-semantic space of elements defined by a specific set of static embeddings, and is given by a set of embedding vectors that correspond to the different facts that can be extracted from the sentence (unlike the usual representations by means of a single vector).
Code is complete EXCEPT Word2vec and Glove embedding files. There are links to download them in the 'embeddings' folder.
The model's benefits are contrasted using semantic similarity tasks between previously labeled pairs of sentences.
